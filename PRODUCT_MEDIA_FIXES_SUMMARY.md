# Product Media Fetching Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing `updated_at` column** in the products table
2. **Cache control issues** preventing immediate refresh of products
3. **Admin products endpoint** using non-existent `updated_at` column for ordering
4. **Media uploads** not triggering immediate refresh in admin view
5. **Frontend caching** preventing users from seeing updated products immediately

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`database_setup.sql`)

- Added `updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` column to products table
- Added comprehensive indexing for media-related queries:
  - `idx_product_images_url` - for faster image URL lookups
  - `idx_product_videos_product_id` - for video queries
  - `idx_product_videos_position` - for video ordering
  - `idx_product_videos_url` - for video URL lookups
  - `idx_products_updated_at` - for admin ordering
  - Composite indexes for category + updated_at queries

### 2. Backend Server Fixes (`backend/server.js`)

#### Media Upload Endpoints
- Fixed image and video upload endpoints to properly update product timestamps
- Added fallback to `created_at` if `updated_at` column doesn't exist
- Enhanced error handling for media uploads
- Added proper cache control headers

#### Admin Products Endpoint
- Added dynamic column checking for `updated_at` column
- Implemented graceful fallback to `created_at` ordering if `updated_at` doesn't exist
- Enhanced cache control headers for admin view
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Admin Frontend Fixes (`admin.js`)

#### Product Management
- Modified `saveProduct()` function to immediately refresh products after save
- Enhanced `handleProductMediaUploads()` function with better error handling
- Added immediate refresh trigger after media uploads
- Improved `loadProducts()` function with cache busting parameters

#### Cache Control
- Added cache busting parameters (`?t=${Date.now()}`) to all product requests
- Implemented strict cache control headers
- Added immediate refresh after media uploads

### 4. User Frontend Fixes (`main.js`)

#### Product Fetching
- Modified `fetchProducts()` to always use cache busting parameters
- Enhanced cache control headers for all product requests
- Added automatic refresh when page becomes visible
- Added automatic refresh when window gains focus

#### Refresh Mechanisms
- Implemented `refreshProducts()` function for manual refresh
- Added visibility change and focus event listeners
- Improved error handling and retry logic

### 5. Database Migration Script (`apply_indexes.sql`)

- SQL script to apply all database changes
- Adds missing `updated_at` column
- Creates all necessary indexes for performance
- Updates existing products with proper timestamps
- Analyzes tables for optimization

## How the Fixes Work

### Immediate Refresh After Media Uploads
1. Admin uploads images/videos
2. Backend updates product `updated_at` timestamp
3. Admin frontend immediately refreshes product list
4. User frontend automatically refreshes when page becomes visible

### Cache Control
1. All product endpoints include strict no-cache headers
2. Frontend requests include cache busting parameters
3. Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
4. Media uploads trigger immediate database updates

### Error Handling
1. Graceful fallback if `updated_at` column doesn't exist
2. Enhanced error messages for media upload failures
3. Retry logic for failed requests
4. Fallback mechanisms for missing data

## Testing the Fixes

### Admin Side
1. Add a new product with images/videos
2. Verify products list refreshes immediately
3. Check that media appears without page refresh
4. Verify admin can see all products consistently

### User Side
1. Navigate to product pages
2. Verify images/videos load properly
3. Check that new products appear without manual refresh
4. Test page visibility and focus refresh mechanisms

## Performance Improvements

- **Faster Media Queries**: New indexes on image/video URLs and positions
- **Better Ordering**: Indexes on `updated_at` for admin view
- **Optimized Joins**: Composite indexes for category + timestamp queries
- **Reduced Caching Issues**: Strict cache control prevents stale data

## Maintenance

- Run `apply_indexes.sql` on your database
- Restart the backend server to apply code changes
- Clear browser cache if issues persist
- Monitor server logs for any remaining errors

## Future Enhancements

- Consider implementing Redis caching for better performance
- Add media compression and optimization
- Implement CDN for media files
- Add media validation and virus scanning
